# Movie Rater Website for Full Stack Project

A simple full-stack website where users can post reviews of different movies.

I've based this project off of Dr. Zufelt's full stack app example (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/nzufelt-full-stack-app-example).
I've also used some code snippets I got from various websites and modified them slightly for this project. In these cases a link to the code snippet source will be commented somewhere around the code.
